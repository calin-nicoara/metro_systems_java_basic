# Java basic for metro systems

This is a presentation in the basics of Java for Metro Systems,

## Structure

The source code is in src/ro/cni/javabasicmetrosystems and it is organized in the following
way.

* the **exercises** package contains the exercise solutions given at the end of each day.

* the **prepared** package contains code with comments that approach the subjects discussed
on a certain day. 

* the **live** package contains the code that is done live on the course day. It probably
differs from the code written in the **prepared** package.


All packages above are organized by day. (ex. day1, day2, ...)
